# hajime README

Hajime is a vscode extension for edting .sumo Sumo Logic query files

## Features

The extension provides following features:
- syntax highlighting
- auto complete for Sumo Logic meta data and search language

## Extension Development
For info on setup see: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension

There is also a useful library of examples here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples

To run the extension in a debug window use F5 - this opens a new window to test the extension. I think this should run npm compile to create .out/extesntion.js but this doesnt' seem to work. Need to fix this so after changes run npm compile first.

then either:
- open a .sumo file
- create a new file and set type to sumo

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.
